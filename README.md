## ✨ Overview

This repository contains blockchain-specialized subagents that extend Claude Code's capabilities for blockchain development. Each subagent is an expert in a specific domain, automatically invoked based on context or explicitly called when needed. All agents are configured with Claude models optimized for task complexity to deliver optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.

## 🤖 Available Subagents

### 📚 [Blockchain Documentation Architect](blockchain-documentation-architect.md)
**Purpose**: Create comprehensive technical documentation for blockchain programs and smart contracts

**Capabilities**:
- Generate detailed documentation for Solana programs and EVM smart contracts
- Create Mermaid diagrams for data flows, PDA relationships, and system architecture
- Produce sequence diagrams for transaction flows and contract interactions
- Document program-derived addresses (PDAs), account structures, and instruction handlers
- Create visual representations of complex blockchain architectures

**Best for**: Program documentation, architectural diagrams, technical specifications, onboarding materials

### 🧪 [Solana QA Engineer](solana-qa-engineer.md) 
**Purpose**: Build comprehensive test suites for Solana programs

**Capabilities**:
- Write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
- Expert knowledge of `litesvm`, `mollusksvm`, and `solana-program-test` frameworks
- Test PDA operations, Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs), and token operations
- Create test coverage for edge cases, error conditions, and security constraints
- Migrate tests between different testing frameworks

**Best for**: Test-driven development, quality assurance, regression testing, test framework migration

### 🎨 [Solana Web3 Frontend Architect](solana-web3-frontend-architect.md)
**Purpose**: Expert guidance for building production-grade Web3 frontend applications

**Capabilities**:
- Build React/Next.js components with Solana blockchain integration
- Implement wallet connection flows for multiple providers (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
- Create robust transaction handling with error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Optimize performance with Core Web Vitals >90 and bundle size <200KB
- Develop comprehensive testing strategies (unit, integration, E2E)
- Implement PWA features and offline support
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance

**Best for**: DApp frontend development, wallet integration, performance optimization, component architecture

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) installed and configured
- Solana development environment (for Solana-specific agents)
- Rust and Anchor framework (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mads-finance/blockchain-agents.git
   cd blockchain-agents
   ```

2. **Configure Claude Code subagents**:
   Copy the subagent configuration files to your Claude Code workspace:
   ```bash
   # Copy subagent files to your Claude Code subagents directory
   cp *.md /path/to/your/claude-code/subagents/
   ```

3. **Verify installation**:
   The subagents will automatically become available in Claude Code and can be invoked contextually or explicitly.

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Documentation Generation
```
user: "Document my escrow program's PDA architecture"
claude: "I'll use the blockchain-documentation-architect agent to create comprehensive documentation with Mermaid diagrams showing the PDA relationships."
```

### Test Creation
```
user: "I need tests for my new transfer_authority instruction"
claude: "I'll use the solana-qa-engineer agent to create comprehensive tests for your transfer_authority instruction using the appropriate testing framework."
```

### Frontend Development
```
user: "I need a wallet connection component that supports multiple Solana wallets"
claude: "I'll use the solana-web3-frontend-architect agent to create a robust wallet connection component with support for Phantom, Solflare, and other popular wallets."
```

### Automatic Context Detection
The subagents are automatically invoked when Claude Code detects relevant context:
- Creating or modifying Solana programs
- Working with blockchain documentation
- Writing or debugging tests for smart contracts
- Building React/Next.js components with Web3 integration

## 🏗️ Architecture

Each subagent is designed as a specialized expert with:

- **Domain Expertise**: Deep knowledge in specific blockchain development areas
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless integration with Claude Code's tool ecosystem  
- **Context Awareness**: Automatic activation based on development context
- **Extensibility**: Easy to modify and extend for specific project needs
